BackStory : 
You are new to the village and Glinda The Horse Ranger has asked for your help!
She needs to start up her Hot Air Balloon but she will need you to go to the Fire Land 
and Ice Land to retrieve the Fire Horse and the Ice Horse!

As a reward she will let you fly up with her in her Hot Airballoon where there a rumours
that you can find a Magical Unicorn!


How To Play : 
Use the W A S and D keys to move around the map. 
Use the mouse to look around the world on your horse.
Go to the area of land to reach the next stage of the map. 
Walk up to Glinda to speak to her.
And press the return key while she is talking to hear more.

Extras : 
Creating this game on a team really helped our team skills
and how to correctly use GitHub while working on a large project.

We created all the artwork using Blender for example the
trees, carrots, horses, airballoon and of course the lovely Glinda herself!
We also created the music from scratch using GarageBand and we created
each scene using the Unity Terrain editor.

Our favourite part of the game is Glinda and the Unicorn as 
they were really fun to make.
